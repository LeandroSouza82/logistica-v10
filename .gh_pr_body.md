Summary:
- Mobile bottom sheet (PanResponder/Animated) and UI fixes
- Compact action buttons: Rota (external nav), Não Entregue (modal+WhatsApp), Finalizar (signature)
- Dynamic route numbering and up/down reorder (immutable splice; forces rerender)
- Persistence of order using AsyncStorage with graceful fallback
- DB updates: signature updates status and lat_entrega/lng_entrega; removes item locally on success
- Color-coding cards by tipo_servico (Entrega/Recolha/Outros)

Testing checklist:
- App opens without crashing on device (Expo Go)
- Cards show badges "1º, 2º" and update on reorder
- Reorder arrows update order and badges immediately
- Map centers on 1st delivery after reorder/start
- Rota opens navigation app for 1st delivery
- Não Entregue modal opens and ENVIAR opens WhatsApp to gestorPhone
- Finalizar opens signature modal; after signing, DB updated and card removed

Notes:
- AsyncStorage is optional; install in mobile with: npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage --legacy-peer-deps
- If you prefer, I can split into smaller PRs (UI vs persistence vs DB update)
